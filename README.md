# ProfitSplitter
Using Solidity and smart contracts to create multiple types of profit splitting contracts


Using solidity to write smart contracts in remix there were three profit splitting contracts written:

AssociateProfitSplitter contract. This will accept Ether into the contract and divide the Ether evenly among the associate level employees. This will allow the Human Resources department to pay employees quickly and efficiently.


TieredProfitSplitter that will distribute different percentages of incoming Ether to employees at different tiers/levels. For example, the CEO gets paid 60%, CTO 25%, and Bob gets 15%.


DeferredEquityPlan that models traditional company stock plans. This contract will automatically manage 1000 shares with an annual distribution of 250 over 4 years for a single employee.

Here is my account before the contracts were deployed:
